<h2>Technologies I Used</h2>

<h4>JavaScript, HTML, and CSS</h4>

JavaScript makes the webpages interactive.
HTML provides the text on each page.
CSS helps style everything to be different, colors, sizes, fonts, and places them in different positions on the page.

<h2>Installation Instructions</h2>

None as of now

<h2>User Stories</h2>
<ul>
  <ul>I am a friend of Kayley's who wants to see what she has learned so far from the program at General Assembly</ul>
  <ul>I am a hiring manager looking to see what Kayley has to offer for our company. I want to see what she can accomplish in these 3 months</ul>
  <ul>I am Kayley's mom who wants her to show me the things she learned because I want to be able to code as well</ul>
</ul>

<h2>Unsolved Problems</h2>

<h4>The layout is still not how I would like. I did not end up putting a winner/ loser message at the end of each game.</h4>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>

I will have as little whitespace as possible, especially on the home page. I will have more things to interact with, and more written about myself. I also want to make it more appealing to the eye, so I will work on that as well.
