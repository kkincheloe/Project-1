           <div class="personal">
            I am from South Georgia, and in the past 3 years I have moved to Kennesaw, Ga to attend college. I love animals and being outside. I stay active by playing with my dogs outside and working out at my local CrossFit gym. I enjoy spending time with my family. I have 3 older sisters, 2 of which live in North Georgia, and my other sister lives in South Georgia near my parents.

                <h3 class="text">I am a Software Engineering student at General Assembly. I expect to graduate March 6, 2024.
                    I do not have any prior history with coding, so I look forward to showing businesses what I have accomplished in only 3 months. 
                    I am a perfectionist, who always tries my very best to perfect anything and everything I do.
                    I am a hard-working individual. I enjoy independent work and group work. I excel in customer service,
                    so I am great at working face to face with customers.
